# Jake's Brain

Jake's personal app. On the iPhone it is a thin native shell; on the Linux PC it is a
chromeless browser window. Both show the same web app served by the PC, so editing the files
on the PC changes the app everywhere within about 30 seconds. Nothing goes through the App Store.

```

## What's inside

The first screen is a home screen: a grid of tiles plus a dock. Each tile is one of Jake's own apps:

| app | what it is |
|---|---|
| Notes | title + body notes with autosave, search, pin, `#tags` and `[[links]]` |
| Tasks | checklist (open / done), badge on the tile |
| Groceries | shopping list grouped by aisle, check items into the cart, "Buy again" chips, badge on the tile |
| Workout | Daily training program with ordered exercises, prescriptions, assessments and progress; live workout logging, rest timers, history and personal records |
| Food | calorie + macro log: today against goals, entries by meal, 30-day history, one-tap usuals. Claude logs to it through the connector |
| Calendar | month grid, day agenda, events |
| Jakestagram | private Instagram: post photos and videos from the phone, feed + grid, hearts |
| JakeTube | YouTube feed of jvscholz, sentdex and Tina Huang (newest uploads, played in the app) |
| JakeGPT | private ChatGPT on the PC's Ollama, streaming, conversations saved |
| Habits | daily check-ins, streaks, 7-day strip |
| Files | read-only browser of PC folders with previews |
| Weather | Open-Meteo forecast for a chosen city |
| Reminders | timed reminders that pop up as iPhone notifications, even with the app closed |
| Reels | today's proposed reels, hook ideas and top performers from the reels tracker |
| Deals | brand deals, deliverables, invoices and what's owed; due dates appear in Calendar |
| People | contact list; `@handle` in any note or deal links that person in the Graph |
| Saved | paste a link and the PC stores the page text for searchable read-later |
| Voice Memos | record in the iPhone shell or add an audio file; Whisper transcribes it into Notes |
| Focus | countdown timer that logs sessions, with a weekly total |
| Day Log | searchable timeline of each day from the auto-vlog transcripts |
| Bots | read-only status of the Zora bot and feed accounts |
| Graph | Obsidian-style graph of everything above, linked by day, tag, note links and @mentions |
| Server | the PC at a glance: uptime, load, memory, disk, one row per service |
| Settings | address in use, deployed build, Reload, per-app settings |

## Claude connector

Claude (the app, claude.ai, Claude Code) can use Jake's Brain like it uses Notion: log food, check
today's totals, add tasks, groceries and notes. It is a custom connector served by the PC through a
tunnel. The same public HTTPS address also serves the iPhone app behind a separate device sign-in.
The PC stores all data; the phone needs internet access and no Tailscale app or VPN.
Claude can do everything the app does, and anything you add shows up by itself after a deploy.
Setup: `deploy/connector/README.md`. Manage the password and Claude connection in Settings → Claude
connector on the PC. Public app sessions last 90 days and can be signed out from Settings.

## Making changes

**From Claude on your phone:** open this repo in Claude Code and ask for the change. When it pushes,
a GitHub Action merges its `claude/*` branch into `main`, the PC pulls within about 45 seconds, and
the app reloads itself. Your laptop can be closed; only the PC has to be on.

**From the Mac:** `deploy/deploy.sh "what changed"` commits, pushes to GitHub, and tells the PC to
pull right away.

Don't edit files on the PC directly. GitHub is the source of truth and the PC only fast-forwards.

**Adding an app:** add an entry to `web/apps.json`, create `web/apps/<id>/index.js` (export
`{ mount(root, ctx), unmount(), route(sub) }`) and `styles.css` (every selector prefixed
`.app-<id>`), an icon `web/icons/app-<id>.svg`, and, if it needs data, `server/apps/<id>.js`
(export `{ id, migrations, register(r, ctx) }`). The server picks modules up on restart; the
launcher picks tiles up on reload. Claude's connector picks it up too, so describe the routes and
request bodies in the module's header comment. `SPEC.md` has the full contract and `web/apps/tasks/` plus
`server/apps/tasks.js` are the smallest complete example.

**Native shell** (`ios/`): rarely needed. Plug the phone in, unlock it, and run
`deploy/install-on-phone.sh`. Simulator: `deploy/run-sim.sh`.

## Desktop version (on the PC)

```bash
deploy/desktop/install-desktop.sh      # once: adds "Jake's Brain" to the GNOME app grid
deploy/desktop/open.sh graph           # opens a window straight to the Graph
```

The window is Brave in app mode pointed at `http://localhost:4800`, so it is the same app.

## First-time PC setup

```bash
deploy/setup-pc.sh
```
